# GolBite — Stadium Matchday Experience Platform (prototype)

An interactive, mobile-first web prototype that connects **fans**, **venue operators** and **clubs / partners** on matchday.
It runs fully in the browser with simulated demo data. No real login, payment, maps or live match data is used.

## Run it

- **Quickest:** open `index.html` in a browser (double-click works).
- **As an installable app (PWA, offline):** serve the folder over HTTP, for example
  `python3 -m http.server 8080` then open <http://localhost:8080>. You can then "Add to Home Screen".

## What's inside

| Area | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Fan: splash, sign-in, setup, Matchday Companion, map, ordering, tracking, history, Group Order | `js/views/fan.js`, `js/views/ordering.js` |
| Play: predictions, quiz, rivalries, quests, mini-game, loyalty | `js/views/play.js` |
| Club Shop: drops, mystery box, lottery, bundles, bag | `js/views/shop.js` |
| Profile, Season Journey, Settings | `js/views/profile.js` |
| Venue Operations (Smart Fulfillment Network) | `js/views/ops.js` |
| Club & Partner Hub | `js/views/partner.js` |
| Stadium Digital Twin (SVG map) | `js/map.js` |
| Simulation: routing, order lifecycle, match events, rewards | `js/engine.js` |
| State and browser-storage persistence | `js/store.js` |
| Demo Controls, Product Tour, router, actions | `js/app.js` |

- Switch roles from the top bar (Fan · Venue · Partner) and language with **عربي / EN** (full RTL).
- The flask button opens **Demo Controls**: goal, halftime, red card, home win, 77' drop, crowd change, route closure,
  pickup overload, sold-out item, event reset, and the presenter **Product Tour**.
- Progress is saved in `localStorage`. Use *Profile → Settings → Reset* to clear it.

## Turning it into a store app later

The code is plain HTML/CSS/JS with no build step, so it can be wrapped as-is with
[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) (iOS/Android) or shipped as the included PWA (`manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js`).
All team names, venues, sponsors, scores and prices are fictional sample data.
